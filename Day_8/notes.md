### What Is React Router?

- A library that manages **navigation** inside React apps.
- Instead of loading new HTML pages, React changes the **component tree**, making navigation instant.

### 🔹 Why React Router?

- Needed for multi-page UI: `/home`, `/products`, `/profile`
- Helps you:

  - Organize features
  - Build dashboards
  - Manage parameters
  - Protect routes (auth)
